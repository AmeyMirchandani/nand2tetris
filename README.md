# Nand2Tetris
This is a project based off [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), 
which uses the book [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p).a

I followed along with the project from the original site: it effectively starts off with designing a logic gate architecture using an HDL (hardware description language), and moves all the way up through the development of a machine language, 
an assembler, a VM language, and a compiler.

Through this, I learned a LOT about how computers are actually implemented, and was actually able to put a lot of this theoretical information into practice!

## Layout
The projects folder has most of the work I actually did, where each numbered subfolder contains separate project files.

The tools folder has a lot of the tooling given by the creators of the course, and can be used to actually run these project files.

The [#]_Writeup.md files each contain a writeup of the work I did on project number [#].
